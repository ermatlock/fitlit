# FitLit 

This is a paired project using React to build an application that allows the user to view all movies, search movie by title, and filter movies based on different categories. The user is also able to click on a see more details button to view the movie's tagline, overview, rating, release date, genres, and runtime if available from the api data available.

# Challenges and Wins
A challenge and win in this project was learning how to use API fetch calls and drilling into the data to get the information we need. The charts.js, getting charts to display were both a challenge and a win. Posting to the API was a win for the team.

# Future Additions
- User receives randomized activity prompt to encourage good habits.
- User interation, ability to pick a date.
- After user inputs data for the day, make page refresh to show current data.
- Sad path testing.
